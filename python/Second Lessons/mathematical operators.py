#Augmented assignment operators
#to change the value of a variable we can aso use these operators to save space and neat looking code without typing extra text 
#for example
x=10
x=x+1
print(x)
#we can perform the same operation without writing it again
x=10
x+=1
print(x)
#both give us the output as 11 as you can see
x=80
x-=10
print(x)
#it really works!!!!
