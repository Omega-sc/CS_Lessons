#format specifiers -- {value.flags} format a value based on hat flags are inserted 

#{variable:.format_specifier} such as .f can specify how many float points are to be included inside the code.
# example- if your number contains 5 decimal points you can limit the no of decimal points appearing in th code using .nf format specifier
#it limits your decimal values to n decimal points. lets say you need 3 decimal points, you specify .3f
#boom!! there you go with three decimal points 
#programming is really incredible and i suggest that you start typing practice real quick so you can type really quickly without having to look down at your keyboard every few seconds... it really helps in removing errors that creep as you type real quick
