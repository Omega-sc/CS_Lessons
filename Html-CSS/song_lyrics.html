Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah, no
Ever since I was a jit knew I was the shit (ooh-yeah)
Shawty keep wanna come 'round, she wanna get hit (wanna get hit so hard)
She think she the main because I keep her by my side
Double-O buss down the watch, she know that I'm timeless (timeless)

I put my son in some Rick
I pull that gun off the hip
Pockets hold 22 clips (ah)
I break her heart, Comme Gar√ßon
Put on a shirt, get put on a blimp
Bih like a stain, get ready to lick

I had to tell her that ever since I was a jit knew I was the shit (oh)
She singin' my songs, she wanna die lit, tryna get hit
House like a bank (house like a bank), deposit this bit, 'posit that check
Smile on my face, ain't fearin' shit, come and get checked (uh)
Ice on my neck, double-O wrist, she in the Scat, helluva 'Cat

Fresh out the trench, 400 packs
Uh, yeah, I'm spinnin' in Paris (uh)
Dress for these hos, they finna flock
Just poured a four in a soda, it pop
Them drugs finna hit, I'm feelin' ill

I'm wrestlin' all of my demons, I feel like The Rock
If I was you, I would cut up my wrist (dumb bit')
XO tatted all over her body, oh (yeah)
She just wanna roll and I don't mind it, yeah
Ever since I was a jit, I been legit (ooh, na-uh)
You should let her go, she wanna be it (oh, yeah)

Double-O tatted on her body, yeah
It don't matter what they say, I'm timeless, yeah (schyeah)
Oh, city on fire when I'm comin' home
Fill up the sky (yeah), I fill up the Dome
They'll play it one day (yeah), it's a hell of a show
But it's gonna hurt 'cause we did it first

Feel like Skateboard P, BBC boys on the creep
Feel like it's '03, Neptune drum with a beam (yeah)
She hippie-flippin' a bean, she wanna fuck with the team
She fell in love with the cream (yeah), she fell in love with the scene

Ooh-yeah, her man quiet, not a peep (oh-na)
Broke his heart, PTSD (oh-na), hold his chest, let it breathe
Let it breathe, niggas scheme, and I got a priest, he got a cross
Get outta line, send him to God, I shed a tear, pray for a loss, ooh-yeah (yeah)
Ever since I was a kid, I been legit (Homixide, Homixide, Homixide, oh, oh)

If I was you, I would cut up my wrist (ah)
XO tatted all over her body, yeah (body, yeah)
She just wanna roll and I don't mind it, yeah
Ever since I was a jit, I been legit (yeah, ooh, na)
You should let her go, she wanna be it (oh, na)

Double-O tatted on her body, oh (body, yeah)
It don't matter what they say, I'm timeless
Timeless (hey), timeless, timeless

Timeless, timeless, timeless, we timeless, oh
Timeless, timeless, timeless (yeah), timeless
